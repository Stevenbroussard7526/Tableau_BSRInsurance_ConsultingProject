<h2>Description</h2>
BSR is a Fortune 500 insurance firm headquartered in Reston, Virginia. Founded in 1967, it has built a reputation for providing best-in-class products for customers as well as being a regular on the Best Places to Work list. BSR’s founders believed that if they took good care of employees, the employees would take good care of customers. For more than 50 years, that simple recipe has proven effective as BSR’s financial and stock performance has demonstrated. Recently, BSR has determined to be more proactive in helping employees to improve their health. While they have long had a corporate wellness program, BSR’s leaders decided to be more strategic in their approach. Specifically, with the guidance of their human resource professionals, they identified the top three opportunities for significant health improvement in their workforce.

<h2>Project Considerations & Questions</h2>

- <b>  Is there a gender wage gap at BSR? </b> 
- <b>  Which employees was the smoking intervention most effective. Smoking cessation program needs greater participation rate? </b>
- <b>  Are fitness interventions more effective for BMI or daily exercise levels? </b> 

<h2>High-Level Data Conclusions:</h2>

<p align="center">
<b> Gener Wage Gap Exploration: <br/>
  
<p align="center"> I observed the existence of gender wage gap by analyzing a linear regression model with tenure (years) as the independent variable and salary as the dependent variable across gender. At the Junior employee level, the salary disparity between genders is relatively minimal, with women merely earning $159 more than their male counterparts, indicating a promising equitable baseline. Remarkably, parity also prevails at the Manager level, where both female ($80k/ year) and male ($79.9k/ year) initiate their tenure on similar salary scales. This level, male employees outpace female counterparts by 60%, showcasing a concerning trend. Upon reaching the Director level, the gender wage gap widens significantly. Notably, male Directors commence with a starting salary of $250k, whereas female counterparts start at $188k, revealing a substantial 74% variance as tenure increases.

 Smoking Intervention Effectiveness: 
  
<p align="center"> Out of 249 employees who opted to participate in the smoking cessation program, only 28 quit smoking (number of cigarettes smoked per day = 0), a success rate of 11% comprising a mix of 21 Junior employees, 1 Director, and 6 Managers who quit smoking. While only 11% of the workforce quit, the overall reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked was 32% across job levels. We also note that the 249 participants reported higher scores on the job engagement and overall job satisfaction, measured by comparing pre (2.6) and post (4.6) satisfaction surveys (range from 1- 5). Overall, smoking levels were reduced, and employees reported higher satisfaction scores. There is no subset for which this intervention was most effective. With average scores increasing in engagement questions and average number of cigarettes smoked decreasing across all employee and job levels, this intervention was generally effective. However, with only 11% quitting completely, BSR should consider other strategies to encourage people to quit completely. We also note the total cost for this program is $1.5M ($6.4k * 249). Total savings are $162k ($5.8k *249 employees)

 Fitness Intervention vs. Daily Exercise: 
  
<p align="center"> The “Get Fit” program had a successful participation rate (67% or 999 employees). We observed participation was evenly split between females and male participation. Across participants, daily exercise time increased by 3.2 mins (or 15.6%) and BMI values dropped from 2.03 BMI points (or 7.9%). Based on research supporting BMI levels at 25, we note that 177 participants improved BMI levels to the healthy level. This translates to a savings cost of $696k annually, as employer sponsored health cost would have reduced from $8.1k to $3.8k. Contrastingly, we established that success for daily exercise levels meant a minimum of 30 minutes daily to achieve optimum health benefits. We note that only 74 employees increased daily exercise to this level, translating to $384k cost savings ($406k savings in diabetes/ cholesterol related health coverage - $22k in program cost).  We recommend BSR investing in the BMI fitness initiative which resulted in a significant health care costs reduction and increased employee performance.
